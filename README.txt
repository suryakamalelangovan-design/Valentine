# Do You Love Me, Maki? 💖

This is a romantic GitHub page that asks “Do you love me, Maki?”

When she clicks “Yes 😍”:
- The song *Munbe Vaa* plays.
- Your photos fade in with falling flowers.
- A heartfelt message appears.

## How to Deploy on GitHub Pages
1. Create a new repository (for example: `love-maki`).
2. Upload all files from this ZIP (`index.html` and the images).
3. Go to **Settings → Pages**, choose `main` branch, root folder `/`, and click Save.
4. Wait 1–2 minutes. The site will appear at:
   `https://<your-username>.github.io/love-maki/`
